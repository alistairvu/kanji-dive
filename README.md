## Key Features

- Spaced Repeitition algorithm: the kanji are split into 8 SRS stages, divided into 5 different groups. You'll see kanji you struggle with more often than the ones you know well.
- Typed Review: typing in the answer helps reinforce what you learned.
- Bulk-add Kanji and Vocabulary Items.
